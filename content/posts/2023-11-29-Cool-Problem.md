Here is a cool problem that I had in one of the problem sets for my Probability and Random Processes course. 

Let $(X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n)$ be independent random variables such that 

$$
\Pr(X_i = 1 - p_i) = p_i 
$$

and

$$ \Pr(X_i = -p_i) = 1 - p_i $$

Let $X = \sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i$. Prove
$$ \Pr(|X| \geq a) \leq 2e^{-2a^2/n} $$.

**Hint:** You may use the following inequality
 $$\pi e^{\lambda(1-\pi)} + (1-\pi)e^{-\lambda\pi} \leq e^{\lambda^2/8}$$
